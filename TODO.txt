1. scutls fastq -rc -only_if_contain -e
    - -rc: output reverse complemented reads
    - -only_if_contain: only reverse complement if reads contain certain sequence
    - -e: allowed error when searching for -only_if_contain 
2. scutls barcode -e
    - if -e is 0~1, treat it as percentage and calculate allowed error automatically by multipying the barcode 1h_full_length_read
    - add -s option in addition to -e, which means that only substitutions are allowed not error.
3. scutls fasta --range 
    - to cut out specified range out of a fasta file 
    - smiliar for fastq
